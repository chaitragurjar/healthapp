# SweChai's Health Insurance App

---
### Features
#### Citizen dashboard
- Patient can see the policies he/she can claim and their respective balances
- Patient can see status of the previous claims (Approved, Rejected or Pending)
- Patient can pay to hospital and get the proof - which can prove the sender, receiver and amount on the ledger.
#### Admin
- Admin is assigned a specific policy
- He/she can see all claims and can approve/ reject them.
- Criteria for approval:
  - The claim proof can be used to validate the txn on the blockchain
  - Available policy balance >= claim amount
- Stats are available - overall and policywise

#### Future scope:
  - Automate and scale in production level (not a few test accounts and wallets)
  - Send sms and mails after claims or payment is made
  - Better map the XRP drops to INR for ease in realworld implementation
  - Better analysis for stats using AI/data analysis (fraud detection etc.)
